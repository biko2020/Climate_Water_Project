Climate Water Crisis Project: Data Collection Guide

Phase 1: Set Up Work Environment

Tools We Need:

*   Excel or Google Sheets (for data cleaning and basic analysis)
*   Python (optional - for advanced analysis)
*   Tableau Public (free - for visualizations)

Create A Project Structure:

Phase 2: Data Collection

Target Regions for Analysis:

*   United States: California, Arizona, Texas
*   Australia: Murray-Darling Basin
*   India: Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu
*   Spain: Andalusia, Castile-La Mancha
*   South Africa: Western Cape, Northern Cape
*   Iran: Fars, Isfahan
*   Morocco: Marrakech-Safi, Souss-Massa
*   Brazil: Northeast region

Dataset 1: GRACE Groundwater Data

Step-by-step download:

1.  Go to https://nasagrace.unl.edu/
2.  Navigate to "Map Archive"
3.  Download monthly data for 2002-2024
4.  Focus on "Groundwater Percentiles" data
5.  Save files as: groundwater\_YYYY\_MM.csv

Data structure you'll get:

*   Location (lat/lon)
*   Date
*   Groundwater percentile (0-100)
*   Drought category

Dataset 2: SPEI Drought Index

Step-by-step download:

1.  Go to https://spei.csic.es/map/maps.html
2.  Select "Download data"
3.  Choose coordinates for your target regions
4.  Download SPEI-12 (12-month timescale) for 2000-2024
5.  Save as: spei\_12month\_[region].csv

Data structure you'll get:

*   Date
*   SPEI value (-3 to +3, where negative = drought)
*   Location coordinates

Dataset 3: Precipitation Data

Option A: World Bank Climate Data

1.  Go to https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/
2.  Select each target country
3.  Download "Precipitation" historical data
4.  Save as: precipitation\_[country].csv


Phase 3: Data Cleaning Checklist

For Each Dataset:

*   Check for missing values
*   Standardize date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
*   Ensure consistent location naming
*   Remove duplicates
*   Document any assumptions made

Key Variables to Create:

*   Drought Frequency: Count of drought months per year
*   Precipitation Anomaly: Deviation from long-term average
*   Groundwater Trend: Year-over-year change in percentiles
*   Severity Index: Combined drought intensity measure

Phase 4: Quality Control

Data Validation Steps:

*   Range checks: SPEI should be between -3 and +3
*   Time series gaps: Identify missing months/years
*   Geographic consistency: Verify coordinates match regions
*   Cross-validation: Compare drought periods across datasets

Expected File Sizes:

*   GRACE data: ~50MB total for all regions
*   SPEI data: ~20MB per region for 24 years
*   Precipitation: ~10MB per country

Phase 5: Preliminary Analysis Questions

Once you have clean data, answer these basic questions:

Drought Frequency Analysis:

*   Which region had the most drought months in the past decade?
*   How has drought frequency changed from 2000-2010 vs 2010-2020?
*   What's the average duration of drought events?

Precipitation Trends:

*   Which regions show significant precipitation decline?
*   What are the seasonal patterns in each region?
*   How variable is year-to-year precipitation?

Groundwater Depletion:

*   Which aquifers show the steepest decline?
*   How does groundwater respond to precipitation changes?
*   What's the lag time between drought and groundwater impact?

Next Steps After Data Collection

*   Data Integration: Merge all datasets by location and date
*   Trend Analysis: Calculate correlation coefficients
*   Regional Comparison: Rank regions by vulnerability
*   Visualization Planning: Design your key charts
*   Story Development: Identify your main findings

Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   Problem: Large file sizes crash Excel
*   Solution: Use Python pandas or break into smaller regional files
*   Problem: Different date formats across datasets
*   Solution: Standardize all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format
*   Problem: Missing data for certain months
*   Solution: Use interpolation or clearly document gaps
*   Problem: Coordinate systems don't match
*   Solution: Convert all to decimal degrees (WGS84)
